What do I need to do to create a Tomagotchi?

    -create stylings for the page including a background and some html with classes
    and ID's so that I can call on them in my js.
    
Where will you need ID's to call on?
    -I will definitely need ID's for the excersize-hunger-sleepiness-boredom
    -The naming area of the page should have an ID
    -The age will need an ID 
    -the buttons for feeding - lights - play with pet
